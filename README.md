iOS application allowing users to set a location on a Google Map and search for jobs within a certain radius of the location they specify.

A list of jobs is returned to them from the Indeed jobs API and they can swipe right on the ones that interest them and left on those they want to skip (using Tinders model as influence).

The app is available in Apples App Store as Job Apis.
